The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was the first temple designed with a central spire. (The design represented a return to the use of spires, as the three previously dedicated temples featured no towers or spires.) The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was originally named the Idaho Falls Temple. The presentation of the endowment was originally delivered by live acting in the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple.",

            "History": "The Rexburg Idaho Temple was the third temple built in Idaho, following the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple (1945) and the Boise Idaho Temple (1984). The announcement of the Rexburg Idaho Temple came three and a half years after the announcement that two-year Ricks College would become four-year Brigham Young University–Idaho. The Rexburg Idaho Temple stands adjacent to Church-owned Brigham Young University–Idaho. The Church's other two universities; Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and Brigham Young University–Hawaii in Laie, Hawaii; also have adjacent temples. While most temple groundbreakings are limited to invited guests, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Rexburg Idaho Temple was open to any and all who desired to attend. Over 8,000 people crowded on the field where the temple now stands.The Rexburg Idaho Temple features beautiful ordinance room murals by Rexburg artist Leon Parson, reflecting the wildlife and landscapes of the Upper Snake River Valley. Parson was the 2010 recipient of the Eliza R. Snow Award. A wheat motif, created by Utah artist Tom Holdman, is used throughout the Rexburg Idaho Temple including most of the 700 art-glass windowpanes. The wheat stalk symbolizes the widespread agricultural industry in the area. The finest materials were used for this House of the Lord including wood imported from Africa and stone and tile from Israel. The exterior walls of the Rexburg Idaho Temple are made of 637 precast panels from 45 different molds, including the retaining wall. The material is called China White—a white quartz finish (mined in Washington state) on concrete panels. A water-proofing compound allows dust to wash off in the rain, keeping the temple a radiant white. Interest in the open house of the Rexburg Idaho Temple was so high that additional early-morning and evening tours were added to each day. Over 200,000 visitors toured the temple. The Rexburg Idaho Temple dedication was delayed one week due to the passing of President Gordon B. Hinckley on Sunday evening, January 27, 2008. President Thomas S. Monson was installed as the 16th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Sunday, February 3, 2008—the day originally scheduled for the dedication of the Rexburg Idaho Temple. He dedicated the temple one week later. In December 2011, the creation of the Rexburg Idaho YSA 8th Stake and Rexburg Idaho YSA 9th Stake made the Rexburg Idaho Temple District the first and only temple district to be comprised of a majority of young adult stakes (YSA and Student Married).",

Hinckley came to Twin Falls in June 2004 to select a site for the Twin Falls Idaho Temple among eight properties under consideration.The former Candleridge Golf Course, located just south of the Snake River Canyon, was purchased as the site for the Twin Falls Idaho Temple.

            "History": "The Boise Idaho Temple was the second temple built in Idaho, following the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple (1945). The Boise Idaho Temple was the first six-spire temple built since the Washington D.C. Temple (1974) and the Salt Lake Temple (1893). The design, created to maximize efficiency, was adapted for 14 other temples built between 1984 and 1989. The Boise Idaho Temple is a sister building to the Dallas Texas Temple and the Chicago Illinois Temple. In 1939, President Heber J. Grant was invited to Idaho's capital where 15 prominent local businessmen offered to the Church any available site in Boise to build Idaho's first temple, but Idaho Falls was chosen due to the concentration of membership in Eastern Idaho. President Grant told the men that when membership increased in the Boise area, a temple would be built there. On December 18, 1982, approximately 5,000 members huddled on the site of the Boise Idaho Temple to witness the groundbreaking ceremony where Elder Mark E. Petersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles presided.",
